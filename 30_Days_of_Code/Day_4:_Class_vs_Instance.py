# Day 4: Class vs. Instance

# Task 
# Write a Person class with an instance variable, age, and a constructor that takes an integer, initialAge, as a parameter. The
# constructor must assign initialAge to age after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is not negative; if a negative argument
# is passed as initialAge, the constructor should set age to 0 and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. In addition, you must
# write the following instance methods:

# 1. yearPasses() should increase the  instance variable by 1.
# 2. amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
#    If age < 13, print "You are young.".
#    If age >= 13 and age < 18, print "You are a teenager.".
#    Otherwise, print "You are old.".

# To help you learn by example and complete this challenge, much of the code is provided for you, but you'll be writing everything in
# the future. The code that creates each instance of your Person class is in the main method. Don't worry if you don't understand it
# all quite yet!

# Note: Do not remove or alter the stub code in the editor.

# Input Format
# Input is handled for you by the stub code in the editor.
# The first line contains an integer, T(the number of test cases), and the T subsequent lines each contain an integer denoting the age 
# of a Person instance.

# Constraints
# 1 <= T <= 4
# -5 <= age <= 30

# Output Format
# Complete the method definitions provided in the editor so they meet the specifications outlined above; the code to test your work is
# already in the editor. If your methods are implemented correctly, each test case will print 2 or 3 lines (depending on whether or not
# a valid initialAge was passed to the constructor).

    age = 0
    def __init__(self,initialAge):
        # Add some more code to run some checks on initialAge
        if initialAge < 0:
            print "Age is not valid, setting age to 0."
        else:
            self.age = initialAge
    def amIOld(self):
        # Do some computations in here and print out the correct statement to the console
        if self.age < 13:
            print "You are young."
        elif self.age in range(13,18):
