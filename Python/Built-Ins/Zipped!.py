# Zipped!

# zip([iterable, ...])
# This function returns a list of tuples. The th tuple contains the th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables.
# If the argument sequences are of unequal lengths, then the returned list is truncated to the length of the shortest argument sequence.

# Sample Code

# >>> print zip([1,2,3,4,5,6],'Hacker')
# [(1, 'H'), (2, 'a'), (3, 'c'), (4, 'k'), (5, 'e'), (6, 'r')]
# >>> 
# >>> print zip([1,2,3,4,5,6],[0,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1])
# [(1, 0), (2, 9), (3, 8), (4, 7), (5, 6), (6, 5)]
# >>> 
# >>> A = [1,2,3]
# >>> B = [6,5,4]
# >>> C = [7,8,9]
# >>> X = [A] + [B] + [C]
# >>> 
# >>> print zip(*X)
# [(1, 6, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 4, 9)]

# Task
# The National University conducts an examination of N students in X subjects. 
# Your task is to compute the average scores of each student.

# Average score = Sum of scores obtained in all subjects by a student/Total number of subjects

# The format for the general mark sheet is:
# Student ID â†’ ___1_____2_____3_____4_____5__               
# Subject 1   |  89    90    78    93    80
# Subject 2   |  90    91    85    88    86  
# Subject 3   |  91    92    83    89    90.5
#             |______________________________
# Average        90    91    82    90    85.5 

# Input Format
# The first line contains N and X separated by a space. 
# The next X lines contains the space separated marks obtained by students in a particular subject.

# Constraints
# 0 < N <= 100
# 0 < X <= 100

# Output Format
# Print the averages of all students on separate lines.
# The averages must be correct up to 1 decimal place.
