# Arithmetic Operators

# Task 
# Read two integers from STDIN and print three lines where:
# The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
# The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
# The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

# Input Format
# The first line contains the first integer, a. The second line contains the second integer, b.

# Constraints
# 1 <= a <= 10**10
# 1 <= b <= 10**10
 
# Output Format
# Print the three lines as explained above.

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
a = int(raw_input())
b = int(raw_input())

print a + b
print a - b
print a * b
