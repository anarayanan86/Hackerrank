# Python If-Else

# Task 
# Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:
# If n is odd, print Weird
# If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
# If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
# If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

# Input Format
# A single line containing a positive integer, n.

# Constraints
# 1 <= n <= 100

# Output Format
# Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.
