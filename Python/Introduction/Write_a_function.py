# Write a function

# We add a Leap Day on February 29, almost every four years. The leap day is an extra, or intercalary, day and we add it to the shortest
# month of the year, February. 
# In the Gregorian calendar three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:
# The year can be evenly divided by 4;
# If the year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless;
# The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

# This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT
# leap years.

# Task 
# You are given the year, and you have to write a function to check if the year is leap or not.
# Note that you have to complete the function and remaining code is given as template.

# Input Format
# Read y, the year that needs to be checked.

# Constraints
# 1900 <= y <= 10**5

# Output Format
# Output is taken care of by the template. Your function must return a boolean value (True/False)

def is_leap(year):
    leap = False
    
    # Write your logic here
    if year % 400 == 0:
        leap = True
    elif year % 100 == 0:
        leap = False
    elif year % 4 == 0:
        leap = True
    
    return leap
    
year = int(raw_input())
print is_leap(year)

# What about eriting in this way. It is short and working.

year = int(input("Enter a year: ")) 
print(year%4==0 and not year%100==0 or year%4==0 and year%100==0 and year%400==0)
