# Set .difference() Operation

# .difference()
# The tool .difference() returns a set with all the elements from the set that are not in an iterable.
# Sometimes the - operator is used in place of the .difference() tool, but it only operates on the set of elements in set.
# Set is immutable to the .difference() operation (or the - operation).

# >>> s = set("Hacker")
# >>> print s.difference("Rank")
# set(['c', 'r', 'e', 'H'])

# >>> print s.difference(set(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k']))
# set(['c', 'r', 'e', 'H'])

# >>> print s.difference(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k'])
# set(['c', 'r', 'e', 'H'])

# >>> print s.difference(enumerate(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k']))
# set(['a', 'c', 'r', 'e', 'H', 'k'])

# >>> print s.difference({"Rank":1})
# set(['a', 'c', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'r'])

# >>> s - set("Rank")
# set(['H', 'c', 'r', 'e'])
