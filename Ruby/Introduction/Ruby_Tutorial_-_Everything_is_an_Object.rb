# Ruby Tutorial - Everything is an Object

# Everything is an object in Ruby. For instance, if you type
# print self
# in the code-editor, Ruby treats self as the object in which it is currently referred to.

# Give it a try!

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
print self
