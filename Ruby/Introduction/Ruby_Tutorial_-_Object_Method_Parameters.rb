# Ruby Tutorial - Object Method Parameters

# A method may take zero or more parameters as input. To demonstrate this, we look at the asserts we use on HackerRank. Sometimes, we have
# to check whether a given number a is within the range b and c (where b  c, and both inclusive ).

# Three variables a, b, and c are already defined. Your task is to write code that checks whether a is within the range of b and c by
# calling the method range? (which we have defined for you as a method for this example) on a and passing b and c as arguments.

# write your code here
a.range?(b, c)
