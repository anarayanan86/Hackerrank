# Ruby Tutorial - Object Methods

# Each object in Ruby may have methods associated with it. To demonstrate this, we want you to print whether a number is even or odd. A
# number has an even? method associated with it, which returns true or false based on the parity of the number.

# Assuming a variable number is already defined, check whether a given number is even or not.

# add your code here
number.even?
